## Project Overview
This project was done as part of the requirements to complete the Udacity React Nanodegree program.
The application is built using React and implements Redux for state management.

### Would You Rather?
In the "Would You Rather?" app a user is able to play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
Users are able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
